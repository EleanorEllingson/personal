	//1. Understand the Problem

    //EX: Write a function which takes in a string and returns counts of each character in the string.

	/*

	*/

		// restate: take a string, count the characters, return the count
		// inputs: string, could be sentence, account for alphanumeric characters (String)
		// outputs: object with char as key and count as value, (charCount)

    //2. Explore Concrete Examples

	//EX: Write a function which takes in a string and returns counts of each alphanumeric character in the string.

	/*

	simple: countChars("aaaa") => {a : 4}

	complex: countChars("hello hey!") => {

	*/



	//3. Break it Down

    //EX: Write a function which takes in a string and returns counts of each alphanumeric character in the string.

    /*

	*/
		function countChars(str){
		//	make bucket obj
		//	loop through string to get chars
		//	check if character is alphanumeric
		//	if it is, add to obj
		//	return object
		}


    //4. Solve || Simplify

    //EX: Write a function which takes in a string and returns counts of each alphanumeric character in the string.





	//5. Look Back and Refactor

    //EX: Write a function which takes in a string and returns counts of each alphanumeric character in the string.
